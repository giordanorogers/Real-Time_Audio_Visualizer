# Real-Time Audio Visualizer

I built this to practice capturing and manipulating audio in real-time using python.
Specifically, this project allowed me to explore pyaudio for the first time.
I also became more familiar with the numpy and matplotlib libraries.
Real-time input to output is very exciting; especially with audio.
I hope to advance my understanding of real-time visualization with future projects.
